# Topic: Global variables and Functions

Global variables can be accessed anywhere inside of a Javascript code. If you want to use ```var``` 
as a global variable it could get very messy and it is not the best practice for software programmers.
It is best to declare global variables with ```let``` or ```const``` as a global variable. 

JavaScript functions can be declared with the name ```function``` and followed by a space with an input name. 
Functions of Javascript can be accessed anywhere within the class as a method or just the function alone without a class. 

Look into the ```example1.js``` 



Function with ```parameters``` are the arguments that passed into that specific function of the name.
The function can use the passed arguments/parameters for different purposes.

Look into the ```example2.js```
